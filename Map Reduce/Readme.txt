Main Program is MainProgram.java
Mapper Program is Map.java
Reducer Program is Reducer1.java


In the MainProgram.java I have written logic to execute Mapper and Reducer.

In Mapper I have converted all characters into lowercase and deleted all the punctuations and then
added the tokens for each line to output. I have also wriiten logic to count 1 time if they are 2 same tokens.

In Reducer I am summing each combination. I have also attached the output file.
